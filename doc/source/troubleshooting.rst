Troubleshooting
===============

Calico related problems
=======================

If you use standalone bare metal servers, or if you experience issues with a
Calico bird daemon and networking for a Kubernetes cluster VMs, ensure that
netfilter for bridge interfaces is disabled for your host node(s):

.. code:: sh

     echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables

Otherwise, bird daemon inside Calico won't function correctly because of
libvirt and NAT networks. More details can be found in this
`bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=512206>`_.

Then reporting issues, please also make sure to include details on the host
OS type and its kernel version.

DNS resolve issues
==================

See a `known configuration issue <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel-ccp/+bug/1627680>`_.
The workaround is as simple as described in the bug: always define custom
intranet DNS resolvers in the ``upstream_dns_servers`` var listed in the first
place, followed by public internet resolvers, if any.

Network check
=============

While a net check is a part of deployment process, you can run the basic DNS
check manually from a cluster node as ``bash /usr/local/bin/test_networking.sh``.
You can as well run all network checks from the admin node:

.. code:: sh

      export ws=/home/workspace/
      ansible-playbook -e ansible_ssh_pass=vagrant -u vagrant -b \
      --become-user=root -i ~${ws}inventory/inventory.cfg \
      -e @${ws}kargo/inventory/group_vars/all.yml \
      -e @${ws}inventory/kargo_default_common.yaml \
      -e @${ws}inventory/kargo_default_ubuntu.yaml \
      -e @${ws}inventory/custom.yaml \
      ${ws}utils/kargo/postinstall.yml -v --tags netcheck

There is also K8s netcheck server and agents applications running, if the
cluster was created with the ``deploy_netchecker: true``.
In order to verify networking health and status of agents, which include
timestamps of the last known healthy networking state, those may be quieried
from any cluster node with:

.. code:: sh

      curl -s -X GET 'http://localhost:31081/api/v1/agents/' | \
      python -mjson.tool
      curl -X GET 'http://localhost:31081/api/v1/connectivity_check'

Diagnostic info collection tools
================================

Configuring ansible logs and plugins
------------------------------------

Ansible logs and plugins are configured with the preinstall role and playbook
located in the `utils/kargo` directory.

In order to make changes to logs configuration without running the
`kargo_deploy.sh` completely, run the following Ansible command:

.. code:: sh

      export ws=~/workspace
      /usr/bin/ansible-playbook --ssh-extra-args '-o\ StrictHostKeyChecking=no' \
      -u vagrant -b --become-user=root -i ~/${ws}inventory/inventory.cfg \
      -e @${ws}kargo/inventory/group_vars/all.yml \
      -e @${ws}utils/kargo/roles/configure_logs/defaults/main.yml \
      ${ws}utils/kargo/preinstall.yml

Note that the `ws` var should point to the actual admin workspace directory.

Collecting diagnostic info
--------------------------

There is a diagnostic info helper script located in the
`/usr/local/bin/collect_logs.sh` directory. It issues commands and collects
files given in the `${ws}utils/kargo/roles/configure_logs/defaults/main.yml`
file, from all of the cluster nodes online. Results are aggregated to the
admin node in the `logs.tar.gz` tarball.

In order to re-build the tarball with fresh info, run:

.. code:: sh

      ADMIN_WORKSPACE=$ws /usr/local/bin/collect_logs.sh

If you deploy from the vagrantfile, you may want to use its NFS mount for
the installer repo and adjust the commands above like this:

.. code:: sh

      export ws=/home/vagrant
      /usr/bin/ansible-playbook --ssh-extra-args '-o\ StrictHostKeyChecking=no' \
      -u vagrant -b --become-user=root -i ~/${ws}inventory/inventory.cfg \
      -e @${ws}kargo/inventory/group_vars/all.yml \
      -e @/vagrant/utils/kargo/roles/configure_logs/defaults/main.yml \
      /vagrant/utils/kargo/preinstall.yml

      ADMIN_WORKSPACE=$ws /usr/local/bin/collect_logs.sh

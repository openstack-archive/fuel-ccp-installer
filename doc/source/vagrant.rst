Vagrant env deployment guide
============================

Requirements:
* Vagrant >= 1.8.5
* Plugin vagrant-libvirt >= 0.0.35
* Plugin vagrant-vbguest >= 0.13.0

To start with defaults, just run ``vagrant up``. To tweak defautls, see the
`vagrant-settings.yaml_defaults` file. You can rename the file as
`vagrant-settings.yaml` end edit it to override defaults as well.
